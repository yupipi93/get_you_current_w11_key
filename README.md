# Get Windows 11 Product Key

This project contains a VBScript designed to retrieve the current Windows 11 product key from the system registry. It is particularly useful when you need to back up your product key before performing a fresh installation of the operating system.

## How It Works

The `productkey.vbs` script reads the encrypted `DigitalProductId` value from the Windows registry and decodes it into the standard 25-character retail product key format.

## Usage

1.  **Download the script**: Make sure you have the `productkey.vbs` file on your computer.
2.  **Run the script**: Double-click the `productkey.vbs` file to execute it.
3.  **Copy the key**: A dialog box will appear, displaying your product key in a text field. You can select the key and press `Ctrl+C` to copy it.
4.  **Save your key**: Paste the key into a text file or another secure location outside of the computer you are about to format.

## Note

It is crucial to save your product key in a safe and accessible place before reinstalling Windows, as you will need it to reactivate your new installation.
